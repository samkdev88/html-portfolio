<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi, I’m Sam. I started out as an Electrical Engineer, drawn to the challenge of understanding 
  how complex systems work and how different parts come together to create something meaningful. 
  Over time, my curiosity began shifting toward the digital world — I found myself fascinated by 
  the way software can transform ideas into experiences and connect people across the globe.</p>

<p>That curiosity became a passion, and it led me to pursue a path in full-stack web development. 
  I’ve been immersing myself in learning how to build clean, responsive, and dynamic applications 
  from the ground up — everything from crafting user interfaces to designing the logic behind the 
  scenes. Each new concept I learn opens the door to countless creative possibilities, and that 
  keeps me motivated to keep pushing forward.</p>

<p>My goal is to grow into a versatile developer who can bring powerful ideas to life on the web. 
  I’m excited about this journey and about the opportunity to combine my technical background 
  with the creativity and problem-solving that web development offers. This is just the beginning, 
  and I can’t wait to see where this path leads.</p>
